# FizzBuzz!!

## What is FizzBuzz?

### FizzBuzz is one of the most commonly asked interview questions for a junior developer.

The goal is usually to print out a set of numbers and for numbers that match a certain criteria E.g. Multiples of 2, multiples of 5 and finally multiples of both 2 & 5.
You will print out the words "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz".

This is sometimes also called the FooBar scenario but it's essentially the same thing but with different words.
